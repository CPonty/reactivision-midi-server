reactivision-midi-server
========================

Unofficial fork of the reacTIVision computer vision framework, exposing webcam to remote configuration via MIDI messages.

Created as a proof-of-concept for future use in UQ's *CSSE3010 - Embedded Systems Design \& Interfacing* course.

This is the Windows build of ReacTIVision. In addition to the standard dependencies, the WinSock library was used to implement the MIDI server, and the DirectShow Video Libray (DSVL) has been modified to expose the required webcam settings.
